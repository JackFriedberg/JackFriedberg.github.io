    <h3>Common Similarities and Differences in Media Consumption: 2004 Students and Current Students</h3>

    <p> One of the common themes that was immediatley obvious when looking through the websites of my peers and then of students from 2004, was how little of the media of 2004 students was internet based 
    compared to today's students. Music is a good example of this. Students from 2004 listened to radio/CDs with the occasional iPod user. Music today is dominated by streaming, a sharp difference from 
    the pre-downloaded nature of the music on an iPod or CD. Today's music technology also represents greater in-moment choice and reflects the cheapness of data streaming that allows that type of flexibility.
