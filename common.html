    <h1> Common Themes in Peers' Media Usage </h1>

    <p style="color:white">
        One of the things that stands out so vividly when I look scross the pages of my peers is the ubiquity of 4 major social media platforms:
        <a href="www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,
        <a href="www.instagram.com" target="_blank">Instagram</a>,
        <a href="www.snapchat.com" target="_blank">Snapchat</a>, and
        <a href="www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
        These websites were on almost every person's page as well as mine.
        While this is far from a surprise, I think it speaks to the supremacy of social media when it comes to shared experiences in our modern media landscape.

        Another interesting pattern I noticed was that very few people listed TV as a source of video media, instead opting for
        <a href="www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>,
        <a href="www.netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a>, and
        <a href="www.hulu.com" target="_blank">Hulu</a>.
        When TV was mentioned, it was usually for something specific such as a TV series, or sports. I'd be interested to see how that changes as Disney and ESPN launch their own streaming services
        and Twitter and Youtube bid for TV rights.

       Finally, the most common service for music that I saw was
       <a href="www.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.
       This may be due to their freemium pricing model that includes a student discount.
