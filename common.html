	<h1> Common Themes in Peers' Media Usage </h1>

    <p>
        One of the things that stands out so vividly when I look scross the pages of my peers is the ubiquity of 4 major social media platforms:
        <a href="www.facebook.com" style="color:white" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,
        <a href="www.instagram.com" target="_blank">Instagram</a>,
        <a href="www.snapchat.com" target="_blank">Snapchat</a>, and 
        <a href="www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
        These websites were on almost every person's page as well as mine. 
        While this is far from a surprise, I think it speaks to the supremacy of social media when it comes to shared experiences in our modern media landscape.
